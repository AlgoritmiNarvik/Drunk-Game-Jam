## Goals

The goal of Drunk GameJam is to create a fun and accessible event for both existing members and potential new members of Algoritmi. By combining coding challenges with a relaxed, beer-infused atmosphere, we aim to break down barriers to entry and make coding more enjoyable.

## Project Plan

1. **Finalize Date**: Confirm the exact date for the event by mid-September.
2. **Collaborate with BeerBrewery Club**: Coordinate with the BeerBrewery Club to ensure there’s enough beer for the event.
3. **Theme and Format Decision**: Finalize the event format and theme selection process.
4. **Marketing**: Design and distribute promotional materials at least two weeks before the event.
5. **Logistics**: Secure a venue, arrange for the necessary equipment, and purchase prizes and drinks.
6. **Execution**: Conduct the event smoothly, ensuring all teams have fun and that the schedule is adhered to.

## Budget Plan

The budget for the event includes costs for drinks and prizes. Based on the previous event, we estimate a total budget of 3025 NOK. We plan to reassess these figures and adjust as needed, especially considering the collaboration with the BeerBrewery Club.

## Post-Event Reflection

After the event, we’ll gather feedback and discuss what went well and what could be improved. Some points to consider:
- Simplifying the coupon distribution process
- Ensuring clear communication and transparency in planning
- Enhancing the design and timing of promotional materials

**Let's code, create, and celebrate!**
